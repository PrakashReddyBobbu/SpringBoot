Basic
Monolithic architecture is built as one large system and is usually one code-base
Microservices architecture is built as small independent module based on business functionality

Scale
It is not easy to scale based on demand
It is easy to scale based on demand.

Database
It has shared database
Each project and module has their own database

Deployment
Large code base makes IDE slow and build time gets increase.
Each project is independent and small in size. So overall build and development time gets decrease.

Tightly Coupled and Loosely coupled
It extremely difficult to change technology or language or framework because everything is tightly coupled and depend on each other
Easy to change technology or framework because every module and project i
